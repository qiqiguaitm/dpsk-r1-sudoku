and your job is to use logic to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid so that each row, column and 3Ã—3 box contains the digits 1 to 9 without repeats.
Assistant: Let me solve this step by step.
<think> Firstly, I'll use the classic Sudoku solving strategy of scanning rows, columns, and boxes.

For example, in Column 2, we see that digits 6, 5, 7, 4, and 8 are all used, leaving digits 1, 2, 3, 9 open. Since digit 9 is already used in the same 3x3 box, it can't go into the spot with column 2. Thus, we can safely place the digit 1 there.

Similarly, I'll scan each row and box to discover missing digits, while also considering that each digit can only appear once in a row, column, or box. This solving approach will help us fill in the blank spaces efficiently and accurately. </think>
